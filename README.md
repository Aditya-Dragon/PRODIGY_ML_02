Task 2 of the internship

Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

# Mall Customer Analysis

In this analysis, we explore customer data from a shopping mall. We employ various data visualization techniques and clustering to gain insights into customer behavior.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

We start by loading the dataset and performing basic data preprocessing tasks, such as dropping unnecessary columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Age Distribution

We visualize the age distribution of customers using a violin plot.

### Spending Score and Annual Income

Box plots are used to illustrate the distribution of "Spending Score (1-100)" and "Annual Income (k$)."

### Gender Distribution

A bar plot displays the distribution of customers by gender.

### Age Groups

Customers are grouped into different age categories, and a bar chart shows the count of customers in each group.

### Spending Score and Annual Income Categories

Customers are categorized based on spending scores and annual incomes, with bar plots showcasing the distributions.

## 3D Scatter Plot

A 3D scatter plot is used to visualize the relationships between age, annual income, and spending score.

## Customer Segmentation with K-Means

K-means clustering is performed to segment customers into five clusters based on their spending behavior and annual income.

## Cluster Visualization

Finally, a 3D scatter plot visualizes the clustered data, with data points colored by cluster label.

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and segmentation based on spending habits and income levels.
